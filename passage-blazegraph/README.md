# Sage тип Blazegraph

Blazegraph's database provides additional properties that we could
exploit for both Web preemption, and approximate query processing.

Under the hood, it uses [*augmented* balanced trees](https://github.com/blazegraph/database/wiki/BTreeGuide)
where each node carries and maintains an additional counter field
representing its number of children. In other terms, it makes efficient:

- [ ] `SELECT <projected> WHERE {<triple_pattern>} OFFSET X`, i.e., jumping at an integer 
  offset when the query is a triple pattern  

- [ ] `SELECT COUNT(*) WHERE {<triple_pattern>}`, i.e., provide the number of elements
  corresponding to the triple pattern.
