# RAWer

RAndom walks sampling over SPARQL queries, but
[better](https://github.com/GDD-Nantes/raw-jena) [2]. Ultimately, it
advocates for a support of online sampling [1] within SPARQL to enable
getting random elements, processing aggregations, optimizing join
order, building summaries etc.

This project is designed to handle multiple backends with a
well-defined scope in terms of supported operators.

## Usage

```shell
Usage: raw [-rh] -d=<path> [-q=<SPARQL>] [-f=<path>] [-t=<ms>] [-l=<scans>] [-st=<ms>] [-sl=<scans>] [-cl] [--threads=1] [-n=1]
RAndom-Walk-based SPARQL query processing.
  -d, --database=<path>   The path to your blazegraph database.
  -q, --query=<SPARQL>    The SPARQL query to execute.
  -f, --file=<path>       The file containing the SPARQL query to execute.
  -t, --timeout=<ms>      Timeout before the query execution is stopped.
  -l, --limit=<scans>     Number of scans before the query execution is stopped.
      -st, --subtimeout=<ms>
                          Timeout before the subquery execution is stopped (if exists).
      -sl, --sublimit=<scans>
                          Number of scans before the subquery execution is stopped (if exists).
      -cl, --chao-lee     Use Chao-Lee as count-distinct estimator. Default is CRAWD.
      --threads=1         Number of threads to process aggregate queries.
  -r, --report            Provides a concise report on query execution.
  -n, --executions=1      Number of times that it executes the query in sequence (for performance analysis).
  -h, --help              Display this help message.
```

```shell
mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true; \

--query='SELECT (COUNT (DISTINCT(?s)) AS ?count) WHERE {?s ?p ?o}' \
--limit=20000 \
-sl=1 \
--report" ## We expect 521585 distinct subjects:

## Backends

An RDF datastore can use this RAW engine by implementing the
interfaces `Backend` and `BackendIterator`. Most importantly, the data
structure in charge of storing the triples/quads must enable (__i__)
range query for a triple pattern, (__ii__) an efficient way to get a
random element from this triple pattern, and (__iii__) the probability
of having picked this element at random.

- [X] Support [Blazegraph](https://blazegraph.com/). Blazegraph uses
      augmented btrees as indexes which store the number of leaves in
      each node. This proves ideal for retrieving the number of
      elements within a range, then getting the element at the
      designated (uniform at random) index.
      
> [!NOTE]
> To ingest your data into a blazegraph dataset, you can use the CLI
> of [`blazegraph.jar`](https://github.com/blazegraph/database/releases/tag/BLAZEGRAPH_2_1_6_RC):
> `java -cp blazegraph.jar com.bigdata.rdf.store.DataLoader -defaultGraph http://example.com/watdiv watdiv10M.properties watdiv.10M.nt`
      

- [ ] Support [Apache Jena](https://jena.apache.org/). Although
      RAW-Jena exists, it requires further modifications to adapt to
      the changes brought by Blazegraph.


## Operators

Operators are divided between sampling operators that return mappings,
and aggregate operators that produce approximate results based on
former mappings. Unlisted operators are probably not implemented (yet).

### Sampling operators

- [X] Triple pattern
- [ ] Quad pattern with `GRAPH` clause
- [X] Basic Graph Patterns (BGPs)
- [X] Join
- [ ] Union
- [ ] Left join with `OPTIONAL` clause
- [X] Bind with a simple expression e.g. `BIND <http://exist_in_dataset> AS ?variable`

### Aggregate operators

> [!WARNING] 
> For now, aggregates are supported at the root, and not in subqueries.

- [X] Approximate Count the number of results with `COUNT(*) AS ?count` based on WanderJoin [3]
- [ ] Approximate Count on specific variables with `COUNT(?v) AS ?count`
- [ ] Approximate Count Distinct on every variable with `COUNT(DISTINCT(*)) AS ?count`
- [X] Approximate Count Distinct on specific variables with `COUNT(DISTINCT(?v)) AS ?count`
